# Analysis of Progresa Program (Mexico, 1997-98)

For this analysis, we will be using data from the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper "[School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387803001858)", by Paul Shultz (available on Canvas).
